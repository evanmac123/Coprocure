                CoProcure makes it easy to collaborate on public purchasing
              </h3>
              <p>
                Each year, local governments in the U.S. spend over one trillion dollars on goods and services. Governments must make purchases using contracts that have been created through a formal competitive bidding process, and most of the
                nearly 90,000 local governments run their own bidding processes, even though they buy similar things. Instead, governments can legally collaborate on purchasing by sharing contracts, a process known as cooperative purchasing. Most
                governments know about cooperative purchasing and want to share contracts, but struggle to find contracts that meet their needs.

              <h5>What is cooperative purchasing?</h5>
              <p>Cooperative purchasing is an established legal best practice that involves sharing procurement contracts between governments. The federal government, states, national and regional purchasing groups, and even local entities all
                create cooperative contracts that can help local governments save time and achieve cost savings. <a href="https://medium.com/coprocure/coprocurement/home">Read more</a> about cooperative purchasing on the CoProcure blog.</p>

              <i></i>
              <h5>If CoProcure is free for governments and suppliers, what&apos;s your revenue model?</h5>
              <p>CoProcure&apos;s contract search tool will always be free to use. Over time, we will develop paid products and features to create additional value for suppliers and government users.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <input type="checkbox" checked>
              <i></i>
              <h5>How does CoProcure benefit diverse business types? </h5>
              <p>Cooperative contracts can benefit suppliers of all types by reducing the costs of selling to governments. However, cooperative contracts can be especially meaningful for diverse businesses such as small, minority-owned, women-owned,
                and local businesses trying to grow within a region. Indeed, many cooperative contracts created by local public agencies or regional purchasing cooperatives have been awarded to diverse suppliers; yet, these contracts are not always
                available to local agencies that may find them relevant. CoProcure makes these existing cooperative contracts more discoverable to other governments within a region and beyond. Better discovery can significantly increase business for
                diverse suppliers, who otherwise might not have the resources or knowledge to leverage a cooperative contract.
